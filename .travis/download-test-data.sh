# This script will download test data from Google Drive.  This data contains
# actual private information, and as such it is encrypted and it will only be
# able to be extracted on the Travis servers.
#
# To download the data, the decryption password needs ot be set in the
# TESTDBPW environment variable, this will only be set on the Travis build
# server and only for builds from the master branch or branches that are
# created by the repository author (this is probably a good idea).  The script
# is designed such that it will not fail if the password is not set, but will
# not download the test data either and as a result some of the tests will not
# run.
